Description:
This is gym management system solution for managing various aspects of a gym, This system allows members to book classes,manage members and also manage waitlist if the gym capacity is full and prompt members with solution if they book for invalid classes, aiming to enhance the experience for both members and administration. In this Article i will describe in detail the core functionality of the programme

Features
Book Classes: Members can seamlessly book various workout classes like (spin, yoga, boxing, regular workout sessions), This feature is designed to ensure that members can find a class that fits their schedule and fitness goals.

View current class statuses: The system provides real-time updates on the status of classes, allowing members to know which classes are full and which have available spots. This is crucial beacuse for members making informed decisions about their workout schedules.

Manage a waitlist if classes are full: In instances where classes reach full capacity, the gym management system offers a waitlist feature. This allows members to join a waiting list for classes so that if a spot opens up, they are immediately notified and have the chance to join the desired class.
